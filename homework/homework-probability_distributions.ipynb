Plot the probabilities of having zero up to 10 mutations. If having eight or more mutations has a 50% chance of being lethal, how many deaths are expected out of 1000 residents of this city?"

Plot the expected distribution of interspike intervals from zero up to the time for which 95% of all intervals are accounted for. If this neuron needs to fire two consecutive spikes within 0.1 seconds in order for a downstream neuron to spike, what is the average spike rate of the downstream neuron?"

(3 pts) Mice are evaluated for depression following an experimental procedure using a set of tests that are summarized by a single score that is presumed to be correlated with their degree of depression. Scores for a group of mice had a mean value of 64 with a standard deviation of 12. Plot the distribution of scores. If a score above 80 is considered as being depressed, what is the probability that a mouse will be depressed following this experimental procedure?"
